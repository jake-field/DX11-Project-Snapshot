# DX11 Project Snapshot

This repository is mainly aimed at displaying my personal C++ hobby project as a snapshot where no protected content is publically listed.
It may not be 1:1 with the private repo in state, code or design, but hopefully offers a quick insight into some of my knowledge of C++/DX/HLSL.

Project uses; C++, DirectX 11, HLSL, Assimp (Asset importer https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
